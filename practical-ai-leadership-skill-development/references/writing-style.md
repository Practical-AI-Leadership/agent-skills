# Writing Style Requirements

## Imperative/Infinitive Form

Write using verb-first instructions, not second person:

**Correct (imperative):**
```
To create a hook, define the event type.
Configure the MCP server with authentication.
Validate settings before use.
```

**Incorrect (second person):**
```
You should create a hook by defining the event type.
You need to configure the MCP server.
You must validate settings before use.
```

## Third-Person in Description

The frontmatter description must use third person:

**Correct:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create X", "configure Y"...
```

**Incorrect:**
```yaml
description: Use this skill when you want to create X...
description: Load this skill when user asks...
```

## Objective, Instructional Language

Focus on what to do, not who should do it:

**Correct:**
```
Parse the frontmatter using sed.
Extract fields with grep.
Validate values before use.
```

**Incorrect:**
```
You can parse the frontmatter...
Claude should extract fields...
The user might validate values...
```
